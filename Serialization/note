To serialize an object means to convert its state to a byte stream so that the byte stream can be reverted back into 
a copy of the object. 
A Java object is serializable if its class or any of its superclasses implements either the java.io.Serializable interface 
or its subinterface, java.io.Externalizable. 
Deserialization is the process of converting the serialized form of an object back into a copy of the object.


Advantages of Serialization
1. To save/persist state of an object.
2. To travel an object across a network.
