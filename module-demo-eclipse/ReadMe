1.First
2.SecondProject

In First Project , create pojo Employee with a getName method.
In First Project, you will find module-info.java, create module with same name as package and export current package



In second Project ,create Test class
In module-info.java, create module same as package, mention "requires com.example" (package of First project)
Goto buildpath > 
    configure buildpath >
                    project > 
                    modulepath > 
                          add select required project(First project) in order to import com.example pacakge.


Remember
you always export package, becuase personal/internal usage packages not good to share
you always import modules, even though module do not give all source packages , some are not exported.
